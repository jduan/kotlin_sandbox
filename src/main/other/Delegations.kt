// Why is this better than inheritance?
// The important part is that you aren’t introducing any dependency on how the underlying collection is implemented. For
// example, you don’t care whether that collection implements addAll by calling add in a loop, or if it uses a different
// implementation optimized for a particular case. You have full control over what happens when the client code calls
// your class, and you rely only on the documented API of the underlying collection to implement your operations, so you
// can rely on it continuing to work.
